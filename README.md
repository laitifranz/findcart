The project aims to simplify the management of the various trolleys or containers located in a warehouse, a company or a factory and keep track of various data; these are then displayed on an application connected to the prototype. It works with BLE and an iOS app developed by me. 

Built with XCode for iOS platforms.

:warning: The code was written in 2018, thus some libraries could be updated and the application has to be retested on the newer versions of iOS and XCode.
